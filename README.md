- 👋 Hi, I’m @hohfeldt21
- 👀 I’m interested in smart contract development and web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript at Frontend Simplified. Also C with CS50 and then eventually learning Solidity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me learn and get a better understanding of programming. 
- 📫 How to reach me is either email at hohfeldt@gmail.com or you can message me here on github.
